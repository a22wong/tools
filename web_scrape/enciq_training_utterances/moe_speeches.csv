1,"Commissioner of Prisons, Mr Desmond Chin,"
2,"NYAA Council Chairman, Mr Teo Ser Luck,"
3,"Award recipients and family members,"
4,Good morning.
5,"I am very happy and honoured to join you today, and I want to congratulate the National Youth Achievement Award or NYAA participants on completing the programme."
6,"In 2000, the NYAA programme was first introduced to youths within the Prison School."
7,The programme was subsequently extended to the youths in the Women’s Prison.
8,"The programme’s objectives remain true, even till today."
9,"It aims to encourage self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility to oneself, to society and to the nation."
10,"In 2018, I was heartened to learn that 128 of you participated in NYAA, and were involved in a range of activities that include community service with Be Kind SG and sports such as touch-rugby clinics conducted by volunteers from Born2Be."
11,"Specifically, for the community service project, the colouring sheets which you have drawn are good engagement tools for the Senior Activities Centres to meaningfully engage the elderlies in their centres."
12,"This year’s theme is “Pilot your Life, Soar to Greater Heights”."
13,"It’s a very appropriate theme, and I find it very touching."
14,"For the first time, the Singapore Prison Service also introduced the Train-the-Trainer’s model whereby the Prison Officers were trained by Singapore Adventurers’ Club to impart outdoor survival skill-sets to the NYAA participants."
15,This provided an additional opportunity for the Prison Officers to build rapport with yourselves.
16,"Indeed, the various NYAA activities have helped you to realise this year’s theme, which is “Pilot your Life, Soar to Greater Heights”."
17,"You were exposed to new experiences, whether it is participating in community service for the first time, trying a new sport, or getting involved in an outdoor activity."
18,"Through these experiences, you have become more self-aware; what you are good at, what are your shortcomings and how to improve those areas."
19,Such awareness will allow you to have better control over your life.
20,"This year, I am proud to announce that we have two NYAA gold awardees - Michael and Ahmad (not their real names)."
21,Let me share their stories about how they took charge of their lives.
22,Michael was misguided by bad company and was involved in gang activities.
23,"His family visited him regularly, prompting him to reflect on his life – what does he wish to achieve in life, what are his dreams and aspirations."
24,Michael decided to change for good so that he would not disappoint his family.
25,He renounced his ties from his gang and took up the Educational Pathway offered by the Prison School.
26,Michael started off with General Education and progressed to complete his GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Levels in the Prison School.
27,"He did well in his ‘O’ levels, scoring distinction for his Principles of Account."
28,"Currently, he is pursuing his GCE ‘A’ levels."
29,Michael is also determined to pick up new skills during his incarceration and has signed up for NYAA.
30,He will receive his Gold Award today.
31,"Next, is Ahmad."
32,"Ahmad was involved in rioting and breach of probation in 2017, which landed him in Reformative Training Centre."
33,It was only when his mother became ill and subsequently suffered a stroke that he realised the need to turn his life around for the sake of his family.
34,"Despite having a PSLE certificate, he was undeterred to pursue knowledge and upgrade himself."
35,He proceeded to further his studies with Prison School and obtained his NT certificate in 2018.
36,"Like Michael, he signed up for NYAA and will receive his Gold Award today."
37,"As part of the Gold Award requirement, both Michael and Ahmad embarked on a project to produce a foot reflexology mat that were presented to CARElderly for their residents’ use at their centre."
38,"Michael and Ahmad, I am sincerely proud of you."
39,You have shown us what it means to take charge of your own destiny and work towards realising your dreams.
40,"It takes hard work and sheer determination, and both of you have made significant progress."
41,"I hope you will continue to stay in the pilot’s seat, taking charge of your life even after the programme."
42,I want to also rally and encourage all of us here to take charge of our lives and our pilot seats.
43,This will give us a renewed view of where we are today and what is to come.
44,No one is perfect; we all have our own strengths and weaknesses.
45,"It is important for us to value our strengths, and at the same time, close the gaps in our weaknesses."
46,"For my friends here, I would like to urge you to be patient."
47,It takes time to achieve what we want.
48,We cannot expect what we want to be achieved within a short period of time.
49,"At times, when the opportunity arises, we grab it."
50,"But many times, we need to be patient."
51,We also need to stay humble in life.
52,"Life is a long journey, and you are still very young."
53,"It is important for you to have that horizon of looking far in achieving what you want, but to also remain patient and humble in doing so."
54,Now I also want to thank the family members who have stood alongside and supported the NYAA participants.
55,Your support and constant encouragement are important to their rehabilitation journey.
56,I sincerely want to thank you; I understand it is not easy for you.
57,I also want to acknowledge the contributions of our community partners.
58,"By coming on board, you have helped our NYAA participants realise their self-worth and led them to recognise that they too, can contribute back to society regardless of their past actions."
59,"I would like to give special thanks to the Singapore Adventurers’ Club, Be Kind SG, CARElderly and Born2Be for your partnership in the NYAA programme."
60,"It takes a village to raise a child, and this is the spirit we are seeing."
61,"I sincerely thank all of you, and I hope you will continue to support this very meaningful and noble effort, because every Singaporean counts."
62,I’d also like to share one more thing with the NYAA participants before I end.
63,I see your family members with us today.
64,"They never gave up on you, and they see you as their children and their family."
65,I hope that in turn you will appreciate what they are doing for you.
66,Never forget them.
67,"Wherever you are, they will always love and care for you and want to invest in you."
68,It’s only fair that you play your part.
69,I want to congratulate all of you again.
70,"I wish you all the best in your future endeavours, as you continue to pilot your life towards greater heights."
71,Thank you.
72,I am happy to join you for this year’s Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Symposium.
73,Why is ECG important?
74,"Because in life, we all need a compass which points us in the right direction that means most to us and best fulfils our aspirations and dreams."
75,"Fortunately for me, I am quite clear about my passion and career direction."
76,"Public service appeals to me most, because I want to feel that I am making a difference to many people."
77,"And while in public service, what I enjoy doing most is reforming policies and executing change management."
78,They make me want to wake up and go to work every day.
79,It gives me a kick that no other kind of assignments can.
80,"But to do change management well, I realised I need a range of skills."
81,"First of all, policy making skills – understand data, analyse trends, conclude how things need to evolve, weigh the trade-offs, and then decide on a concrete course of action."
82,It is a tough discipline that takes years to hone.
83,"But being a Minister now, I realise those are just the basics, because change management does not stop at just decision making – I need a much wider repertoire of skills."
84,"For example, I need to communicate the change clearly to the public; I need to privately persuade partners and colleagues to support the course of action; I need to further sharpen my policy analysis skills by raising my proficiency in data literacy, and using new technology to understand data; reading history helps me acquire a deeper understanding of issues and gain some wisdom; for more effective public communications it also helps greatly if I know another official language."
85,I also need to be better at campaigning during an election; I need to win in order to continue doing what I like to do.
86,"Once we know what we love to do, the career we pursue and the skills we need to acquire or deepen, naturally sort themselves out."
87,"But a fact that is perhaps surprising to many, is that I discovered my passion only in my early 40’s or late 30’s."
88,I don’t think it is late – Confucius’ prescription is that one knows your purpose in life only at 50 (“五十知天命”).
89,All those years where as a teenager I told myself I am passionate about mathematics because it was my strongest subject – that was not real passion.
90,It was what it was – my strongest academic subject.
91,"In hindsight, as a student and young working adult, I was actually quite lost."
92,"It was only when I had enough career experience, having worked in Ministries, statutory board, as a trade negotiator, as a union leader, and in the private sector, that I concluded that the kind of work that appeals to me most is what I have just described."
93,I am not alone.
94,"Most of our students, and even most of us, have not found our career compass yet, especially when the education system and modern economy present us with so many options."
95,"Students often resort to choosing courses which their friends are enrolling in, because the institutions look very cool or their parents told them to, or the entry cut-off points match their aggregate scores."
96,That is why we need ECG.
97,"It is difficult for a student to discover their passion and career purpose at a young age, but hopefully ECG can get them to start thinking about it."
98,"It is probably unrealistic to expect ECG to help every student, or even the majority of students to discover their passion during their formative education years."
99,"But it is possible to raise their level of self-awareness, help them recognise their strengths, give them some a broad idea of what kind of work brings them the most joy."
100,"Not quite a compass yet, but we would have at least magnetised the needle."
101,"For many years, straight A’s is the holy grail of many parents and students."
102,"But I think in this new era of SkillsFuture and lifelong learning, knowing one’s passion may in time be the new straight A’s, because it is our passion and inner motivations that guides us through a lifelong journey of learning, skills mastery and contributing to society."
103,"Today, we see more employers trying to suss out the inner motivations of a candidate, as opposed to just looking at their academic results."
104,"While preparing for this speech, I went back to the first speech I delivered as the Acting Minister of Higher Education and Skills."
105,"I was speaking at an OECD Conference held in Singapore, and that was when I spoke about the topic of passion and lifelong learning."
106,"I thought it may be worthwhile reiterating some of the points made then, for those beliefs continue to guide me in my work at MOE today."
107,Our education system in Singapore started off with the aim of helping our country survive and our people to earn our own living.
108,"So the system focused on imbibing common values, teaching languages, literacy and foundational skills."
109,"These national imperatives guided us in our education system, resulting in it being top-down, functional, preserving and integrating."
110,"But to a young person today, he or she may be much less attracted by the national imperatives of education."
111,"For them, education is often about choices – where and how to channel their energies and passions."
112,"They want to grow into interesting vocations and professions, where they can bring joy to people, save the environment, protect the lives of their loved ones or their fellow countrymen, cure the sick, uphold justice, or change life as we know it."
113,So we cannot just offer them career counselling and introduce to them the variety of job possibilities when what they really want to know is the meaning behind those jobs.
114,"So more and more, the objective of education is to recognise that each of us has innate talents, abilities, and interests, and our education system must help our young uncover and pursue their passions, and find out where their inner compass is pointing."
115,"Such a system is bottom-up, aspirational, changing and diversifying."
116,But it does not mean the national imperative of education has to take a back seat and give way to personal aspirations.
117,That is a false dilemma.
118,"Because now, the collective good of a competitive economy and resilient Singapore is attained only if individual Singaporeans can pursue their own talents and passions, feel that every one of us count, and our diversity of talents is complementary and nourishes our society."
119,This may put into perspective why we have the SkillsFuture movement and develop multiple pathways in the education system; why we are opening up more opportunities for lifelong learning; why we are making an effort to dial back the over-emphasis of examinations and academic grades; and phasing out the streaming system and replacing it with subject-based banding to unlock the growth mindsets of our students.
120,"While these structural changes are important, equally important are the interventions in classrooms and the lessons we are imparting to students."
121,"That is why we invested in the development of an ECG system as an integral part of our education curriculum, from secondary schools to ITE and polytechnics."
122,"Today, we have a functioning machinery that is starting to deliver results."
123,"First, in terms of physical infrastructure, we have set up dedicated ECG Centres at MOE, and at each of the polytechnics and ITE colleges."
124,"The staff of these centres organise career talks, sharing sessions and visits, and provide information resources for students and parents."
125,ECG Counsellors at the centres provide direct consultations for students.
126,"In 2018, the Counsellors saw more than 14,000 students, which is a 40% increase from 2017."
127,"Second, in terms of personnel, we have recruited about 100 ECG Counsellors."
128,We look for professionals who believe in the importance of ECG and giving guidance to our young.
129,We also ensure that ECG Counsellors come from diverse backgrounds and experiences.
130,"Today, in the polytechnics and ITE, one third of the counsellors are from the education and training profession, and two-thirds have at least five years of working experience in industries such as info-communications, banking and finance, engineering and healthcare."
131,"They are able to synthesise their experiences in the real world of work with classroom learning, and offer a healthy breadth of perspectives to enable students to make the best of their options and opportunities."
132,The ECG Counsellors are constantly developing their competencies.
133,They go through regular professional training to develop their counselling and facilitation skills.
134,They also keep their understanding of industries current through formal courses and informal channels.
135,"Over the past three years, they attended close to 60 organised industry networking sessions and learning journeys, across more than 20 sectors."
136,"Third, the curriculum."
137,We have developed a structured curriculum with defined learning outcomes.
138,"Today, in secondary schools, the ECG curriculum is about 16-20 hours."
139,"The emphasis is on career exploration, and not to make the students immediately pin-point a career to pursue."
140,"We want students to deepen their understanding of themselves through various psychological assessment tools and discussion with the Counsellors, and get a glimpse into the world of work."
141,"In polytechnics and ITE, the ECG curriculum is about 40-60 hours, where the emphasis shifts towards career planning."
142,Students develop information-gathering and decision-making skills to evaluate options and make informed career decisions.
143,Internships in their final year is an important cap stone to further clarify their interests.
144,"And before their transition to work, students are also taught good work ethics and job search skills such as resume writing and handling an employment interview."
145,"Finally, institutions are also creating more opportunities for students to be exposed to industry, meet with potential role models, and spark their passions."
146,"So there are various industry project teams, mentorship programmes, and entrepreneurship opportunities."
147,A latest initiative by the polytechnics is the Future City Programme.
148,"It brings together students from different polys and disciplines, academia, industry, and government representatives to work on various urban solutions for a city of the future."
149,"This is interesting, because it enables students to understand how different skillsets in engineering, data analytics, IT, and design can be applied in a multi-disciplinary project."
150,"It brings home the point that in ECG, we should be more focused on the purpose of our work, what we seek to achieve and the difference we want to make, as opposed to just answering the question of what I enjoy studying most."
151,You can study anything and still achieve the purpose you had set out.
152,"Let me end my speech with a story, which is a bit unconventional but interesting."
153,"This is about Mr Muhamed Faizal Bin Abdul Kadir, currently an ECG Counsellor looking after secondary schools in the West."
154,His journey of self-discovery is not short of twist and turns.
155,"He graduated with a Diploma in Business Administration, and during an internship, realised he was more interested in graphic design."
156,Sounds familiar?
157,"So after he graduated from polytechnic and enlisted into National Service, he started to learn graphic design seriously during his free time."
158,"Thereafter, he set up his own graphic design house and then became a polytechnic lecturer in digital animation."
159,"He might have taken a wrong turn when he was young, but felt that it was normal for someone's interests and aspirations to change as they grow, and whatever he has learnt is never wasted."
160,"Today, he relishes his work as an ECG Counsellor, because he can guide others who face the same situation as him."
161,Faizal also recalled a memorable case.
162,A student who was on the verge of dropping out was referred to him.
163,"She had failed her modules, repeated them and failed again."
164,"Anxious and aimless, she was unsure what her next steps were."
165,"He found out that she had previously graduated from ITE with a 4.0 GPA, but did not excel in polytechnic."
166,He made the brave but professional conclusion that the student was not ready for a polytechnic education yet.
167,"So rather than ‘scraping through poly’, which was her plan, he helped her realise the value of starting work first."
168,Faizal pointed her to a few job openings.
169,"Soon after, the student informed him that she received two job offers, including one as an administrative staff in the civil service."
170,"Now, she is happy to be working and learning new skills on the job."
171,"At some point, when she is ready and wants to complete her polytechnic education, I am sure her employer will be supportive, and the polytechnic will welcome her back."
172,"This is just one example, but I am sure we have helped hundreds like this student."
173,"This is your collective mission, to strive to find the best education and career fit for students – even if it may not seem obvious, or does not conform to conventional wisdom."
174,I wish you a fruitful symposium.
175,Thank you.
176,There's a nice quote that I came across previously: There are three apples that changed the world.
177,"The first tempted Eve, the second inspired Newton, and the third was offered to the world half-eaten by Steve Jobs."
178,"I am happy to join you today to mark the launch of the collaborations between Apple, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and three educational institutions – the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), RMIT Online, and Pathlight School."
179,"Through these collaborations, Singaporeans across all ages will be able to pick up coding skills - from introductory courses for beginners, to Professional Conversion Programmes for those who wish to enter the sector, and specialised programmes for those who are already in the sector."
180,"I want to especially thank Apple for forging these partnerships, and initiating them to create learning opportunities for our people."
181,Literacy is a basic and big part of our education system.
182,"Language literacy is critically important, and has to start from young, because it is a generative skill that makes learning everything else possible."
183,"In Singapore schools, we focus on English because of its value as a global business language; and Mother Tongue literacy because it helps the different ethnic groups in Singapore know about our own culture."
184,Digital literacy could well be considered a critical third form of literacy for the future.
185,"Not everyone needs to be an IT expert, or a professional coder."
186,"But digital technology is going to be ubiquitous, and drive almost everything we do."
187,"All of us must be able to live alongside, and make use of digital technology, much like how all of us need to know English and our Mother Tongue languages to function happily in our society."
188,"With this in mind, we need to start to demystify digital technology for the masses, and make its learning accessible to everyone."
189,We have been expanding the range of digital-oriented initiatives across our education and training landscape in Singapore.
190,"For school-going young children, we do this through the Code for Fun enrichment programme, which has been available at all our primary and secondary schools since 2017."
191,"This joint effort between MOE and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) exposes our students to coding and computational thinking, complementing what they learn in Mathematics class about logical thinking and problem solving."
192,This lays the foundation for students to pursue their interests in digital technology further through Infocomm Club Co-Curricular Activities or Applied Learning Programmes in their schools.
193,Several schools have also started creating a digital environment where students use wearable technology to make electronic payments in the school canteens and stationery shops.
194,"Through an app, their parents can keep watch over their children's spending, savings, and eating habits."
195,"Some parents protested and said they prefer cash, because children can see that they are not saving when the cash disappears."
196,But we have to get used to looking at digital numbers.
197,We are progressively rolling out the Parents Gateway mobile app to all schools.
198,"It provides a digital platform for schools to communicate with parents on school programmes and activities, and handle administrative matters more efficiently."
199,This also helps reduce administrative workload on teachers.
200,We have also leveraged technology in conducting lessons.
201,"Over the last two years, we have progressively rolled out the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)."
202,This online learning portal holds the materials for the entire curriculum of our school subjects – across all subjects and levels.
203,It provides students with resources to prepare for classes and revisit lessons.
204,"Teachers, through the SLS, can see different approaches and ideas to conduct their classes."
205,"And if they come up with a good idea, they can upload it onto the app."
206,It is a dynamic space which is still being built up.
207,"I think the growth will be exponential, and it will be strategic to education delivery in the future."
208,"We have also started to explore e-examinations, beginning with the implementation of e-oral examinations – where students talk about a video instead of a picture - across all levels for Mother Tongue Language subjects."
209,This will be extended to GCE “N” and “O” Level English in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
210,"We have also piloted computer-based writing examinations for Mother Tongue Language and Literature, and so far the feedback has been quite positive."
211,"At our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), we are ramping up our digital talent pipeline to meet the growing demand for specialists in this area."
212,"Over the last three years, the intake for Infocomm Technology courses at the National University of Singapore has more than doubled, while Nanyang Technological University’s has grown by nearly 50%."
213,SMU will be offering new computer-related courses such as the B.Sc.
214,"(Computer Science) with IT Solution Development major, for which they plan to double their initial intake over the next three years."
215,And of course SUTD has always had a strong pillar in IT.
216,"Our IHLs have also worked with various partners to roll out FinTech programmes, covering areas such as e-payment solutions, to students and teachers."
217,"Many IHLs have also created makerspaces and incubation projects, such as Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Sandbox for innovation and entrepreneurship projects, or the Singapore Institute of Technology’s SkillsCraft Community Innovation Makerspace."
218,The experience of a student in an IHL today is so different.
219,"Back in the day, we spent most of our time in libraries."
220,Today’s libraries do not even have books – everything is accessed digitally.
221,"Today, students are spending their time in makerspaces creating and tinkering with all kinds of gadgets instead."
222,"These spaces encourage our students to exercise their computational thinking skills to design, build and create things, using high-tech equipment."
223,"As for our working adults, we have a programme called SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace, a short one- or two-day workshop, which is heavily subsidised, and rolled out nationwide."
224,"It is our basic community programme to help Singaporeans equip themselves with basic digital skills, so that we can all be users of digital technology."
225,"For the more initiated, they can also take up training programmes in data analytics or cyber security, which has been made available through Government programmes such as the SkillsFuture Series and the TechSkills Accelerator."
226,All these are part of the Singapore Government’s strong digital push in our education and training ecosystem.
227,"We will continue to press on ahead with this effort, and I welcome this latest collaboration centring around Apple."
228,"Since coding is as much about the application of computer science as it is about the art of creating innovative solutions, it is quite fitting that we celebrate their launch here today in this beautiful museum."
229,"And just like the lotus flower that this building resembles, I look forward to seeing these collaborations blossom and grow."
230,"Commissioner of Prisons, Mr Desmond Chin,"
231,"NYAA Council Chairman, Mr Teo Ser Luck,"
232,"Award recipients and family members,"
233,Good morning.
234,"I am very happy and honoured to join you today, and I want to congratulate the National Youth Achievement Award or NYAA participants on completing the programme."
235,"In 2000, the NYAA programme was first introduced to youths within the Prison School."
236,The programme was subsequently extended to the youths in the Women’s Prison.
237,"The programme’s objectives remain true, even till today."
238,"It aims to encourage self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility to oneself, to society and to the nation."
239,"In 2018, I was heartened to learn that 128 of you participated in NYAA, and were involved in a range of activities that include community service with Be Kind SG and sports such as touch-rugby clinics conducted by volunteers from Born2Be."
240,"Specifically, for the community service project, the colouring sheets which you have drawn are good engagement tools for the Senior Activities Centres to meaningfully engage the elderlies in their centres."
241,"This year’s theme is “Pilot your Life, Soar to Greater Heights”."
242,"It’s a very appropriate theme, and I find it very touching."
243,"For the first time, the Singapore Prison Service also introduced the Train-the-Trainer’s model whereby the Prison Officers were trained by Singapore Adventurers’ Club to impart outdoor survival skill-sets to the NYAA participants."
244,This provided an additional opportunity for the Prison Officers to build rapport with yourselves.
245,"Indeed, the various NYAA activities have helped you to realise this year’s theme, which is “Pilot your Life, Soar to Greater Heights”."
246,"You were exposed to new experiences, whether it is participating in community service for the first time, trying a new sport, or getting involved in an outdoor activity."
247,"Through these experiences, you have become more self-aware; what you are good at, what are your shortcomings and how to improve those areas."
248,Such awareness will allow you to have better control over your life.
249,"This year, I am proud to announce that we have two NYAA gold awardees - Michael and Ahmad (not their real names)."
250,Let me share their stories about how they took charge of their lives.
251,Michael was misguided by bad company and was involved in gang activities.
252,"His family visited him regularly, prompting him to reflect on his life – what does he wish to achieve in life, what are his dreams and aspirations."
253,Michael decided to change for good so that he would not disappoint his family.
254,He renounced his ties from his gang and took up the Educational Pathway offered by the Prison School.
255,Michael started off with General Education and progressed to complete his GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Levels in the Prison School.
256,"He did well in his ‘O’ levels, scoring distinction for his Principles of Account."
257,"Currently, he is pursuing his GCE ‘A’ levels."
258,Michael is also determined to pick up new skills during his incarceration and has signed up for NYAA.
259,He will receive his Gold Award today.
260,"Next, is Ahmad."
261,"Ahmad was involved in rioting and breach of probation in 2017, which landed him in Reformative Training Centre."
262,It was only when his mother became ill and subsequently suffered a stroke that he realised the need to turn his life around for the sake of his family.
263,"Despite having a PSLE certificate, he was undeterred to pursue knowledge and upgrade himself."
264,He proceeded to further his studies with Prison School and obtained his NT certificate in 2018.
265,"Like Michael, he signed up for NYAA and will receive his Gold Award today."
266,"As part of the Gold Award requirement, both Michael and Ahmad embarked on a project to produce a foot reflexology mat that were presented to CARElderly for their residents’ use at their centre."
267,"Michael and Ahmad, I am sincerely proud of you."
268,You have shown us what it means to take charge of your own destiny and work towards realising your dreams.
269,"It takes hard work and sheer determination, and both of you have made significant progress."
270,"I hope you will continue to stay in the pilot’s seat, taking charge of your life even after the programme."
271,I want to also rally and encourage all of us here to take charge of our lives and our pilot seats.
272,This will give us a renewed view of where we are today and what is to come.
273,No one is perfect; we all have our own strengths and weaknesses.
274,"It is important for us to value our strengths, and at the same time, close the gaps in our weaknesses."
275,"For my friends here, I would like to urge you to be patient."
276,It takes time to achieve what we want.
277,We cannot expect what we want to be achieved within a short period of time.
278,"At times, when the opportunity arises, we grab it."
279,"But many times, we need to be patient."
280,We also need to stay humble in life.
281,"Life is a long journey, and you are still very young."
282,"It is important for you to have that horizon of looking far in achieving what you want, but to also remain patient and humble in doing so."
283,Now I also want to thank the family members who have stood alongside and supported the NYAA participants.
284,Your support and constant encouragement are important to their rehabilitation journey.
285,I sincerely want to thank you; I understand it is not easy for you.
286,I also want to acknowledge the contributions of our community partners.
287,"By coming on board, you have helped our NYAA participants realise their self-worth and led them to recognise that they too, can contribute back to society regardless of their past actions."
288,"I would like to give special thanks to the Singapore Adventurers’ Club, Be Kind SG, CARElderly and Born2Be for your partnership in the NYAA programme."
289,"It takes a village to raise a child, and this is the spirit we are seeing."
290,"I sincerely thank all of you, and I hope you will continue to support this very meaningful and noble effort, because every Singaporean counts."
291,I’d also like to share one more thing with the NYAA participants before I end.
292,I see your family members with us today.
293,"They never gave up on you, and they see you as their children and their family."
294,I hope that in turn you will appreciate what they are doing for you.
295,Never forget them.
296,"Wherever you are, they will always love and care for you and want to invest in you."
297,It’s only fair that you play your part.
298,I want to congratulate all of you again.
299,"I wish you all the best in your future endeavours, as you continue to pilot your life towards greater heights."
300,Thank you.
301,I am happy to join you for this year’s Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Symposium.
302,Why is ECG important?
303,"Because in life, we all need a compass which points us in the right direction that means most to us and best fulfils our aspirations and dreams."
304,"Fortunately for me, I am quite clear about my passion and career direction."
305,"Public service appeals to me most, because I want to feel that I am making a difference to many people."
306,"And while in public service, what I enjoy doing most is reforming policies and executing change management."
307,They make me want to wake up and go to work every day.
308,It gives me a kick that no other kind of assignments can.
309,"But to do change management well, I realised I need a range of skills."
310,"First of all, policy making skills – understand data, analyse trends, conclude how things need to evolve, weigh the trade-offs, and then decide on a concrete course of action."
311,It is a tough discipline that takes years to hone.
312,"But being a Minister now, I realise those are just the basics, because change management does not stop at just decision making – I need a much wider repertoire of skills."
313,"For example, I need to communicate the change clearly to the public; I need to privately persuade partners and colleagues to support the course of action; I need to further sharpen my policy analysis skills by raising my proficiency in data literacy, and using new technology to understand data; reading history helps me acquire a deeper understanding of issues and gain some wisdom; for more effective public communications it also helps greatly if I know another official language."
314,I also need to be better at campaigning during an election; I need to win in order to continue doing what I like to do.
315,"Once we know what we love to do, the career we pursue and the skills we need to acquire or deepen, naturally sort themselves out."
316,"But a fact that is perhaps surprising to many, is that I discovered my passion only in my early 40’s or late 30’s."
317,I don’t think it is late – Confucius’ prescription is that one knows your purpose in life only at 50 (“五十知天命”).
318,All those years where as a teenager I told myself I am passionate about mathematics because it was my strongest subject – that was not real passion.
319,It was what it was – my strongest academic subject.
320,"In hindsight, as a student and young working adult, I was actually quite lost."
321,"It was only when I had enough career experience, having worked in Ministries, statutory board, as a trade negotiator, as a union leader, and in the private sector, that I concluded that the kind of work that appeals to me most is what I have just described."
322,I am not alone.
323,"Most of our students, and even most of us, have not found our career compass yet, especially when the education system and modern economy present us with so many options."
324,"Students often resort to choosing courses which their friends are enrolling in, because the institutions look very cool or their parents told them to, or the entry cut-off points match their aggregate scores."
325,That is why we need ECG.
326,"It is difficult for a student to discover their passion and career purpose at a young age, but hopefully ECG can get them to start thinking about it."
327,"It is probably unrealistic to expect ECG to help every student, or even the majority of students to discover their passion during their formative education years."
328,"But it is possible to raise their level of self-awareness, help them recognise their strengths, give them some a broad idea of what kind of work brings them the most joy."
329,"Not quite a compass yet, but we would have at least magnetised the needle."
330,"For many years, straight A’s is the holy grail of many parents and students."
331,"But I think in this new era of SkillsFuture and lifelong learning, knowing one’s passion may in time be the new straight A’s, because it is our passion and inner motivations that guides us through a lifelong journey of learning, skills mastery and contributing to society."
332,"Today, we see more employers trying to suss out the inner motivations of a candidate, as opposed to just looking at their academic results."
333,"While preparing for this speech, I went back to the first speech I delivered as the Acting Minister of Higher Education and Skills."
334,"I was speaking at an OECD Conference held in Singapore, and that was when I spoke about the topic of passion and lifelong learning."
335,"I thought it may be worthwhile reiterating some of the points made then, for those beliefs continue to guide me in my work at MOE today."
336,Our education system in Singapore started off with the aim of helping our country survive and our people to earn our own living.
337,"So the system focused on imbibing common values, teaching languages, literacy and foundational skills."
338,"These national imperatives guided us in our education system, resulting in it being top-down, functional, preserving and integrating."
339,"But to a young person today, he or she may be much less attracted by the national imperatives of education."
340,"For them, education is often about choices – where and how to channel their energies and passions."
341,"They want to grow into interesting vocations and professions, where they can bring joy to people, save the environment, protect the lives of their loved ones or their fellow countrymen, cure the sick, uphold justice, or change life as we know it."
342,So we cannot just offer them career counselling and introduce to them the variety of job possibilities when what they really want to know is the meaning behind those jobs.
343,"So more and more, the objective of education is to recognise that each of us has innate talents, abilities, and interests, and our education system must help our young uncover and pursue their passions, and find out where their inner compass is pointing."
344,"Such a system is bottom-up, aspirational, changing and diversifying."
345,But it does not mean the national imperative of education has to take a back seat and give way to personal aspirations.
346,That is a false dilemma.
347,"Because now, the collective good of a competitive economy and resilient Singapore is attained only if individual Singaporeans can pursue their own talents and passions, feel that every one of us count, and our diversity of talents is complementary and nourishes our society."
348,This may put into perspective why we have the SkillsFuture movement and develop multiple pathways in the education system; why we are opening up more opportunities for lifelong learning; why we are making an effort to dial back the over-emphasis of examinations and academic grades; and phasing out the streaming system and replacing it with subject-based banding to unlock the growth mindsets of our students.
349,"While these structural changes are important, equally important are the interventions in classrooms and the lessons we are imparting to students."
350,"That is why we invested in the development of an ECG system as an integral part of our education curriculum, from secondary schools to ITE and polytechnics."
351,"Today, we have a functioning machinery that is starting to deliver results."
352,"First, in terms of physical infrastructure, we have set up dedicated ECG Centres at MOE, and at each of the polytechnics and ITE colleges."
353,"The staff of these centres organise career talks, sharing sessions and visits, and provide information resources for students and parents."
354,ECG Counsellors at the centres provide direct consultations for students.
355,"In 2018, the Counsellors saw more than 14,000 students, which is a 40% increase from 2017."
356,"Second, in terms of personnel, we have recruited about 100 ECG Counsellors."
357,We look for professionals who believe in the importance of ECG and giving guidance to our young.
358,We also ensure that ECG Counsellors come from diverse backgrounds and experiences.
359,"Today, in the polytechnics and ITE, one third of the counsellors are from the education and training profession, and two-thirds have at least five years of working experience in industries such as info-communications, banking and finance, engineering and healthcare."
360,"They are able to synthesise their experiences in the real world of work with classroom learning, and offer a healthy breadth of perspectives to enable students to make the best of their options and opportunities."
361,The ECG Counsellors are constantly developing their competencies.
362,They go through regular professional training to develop their counselling and facilitation skills.
363,They also keep their understanding of industries current through formal courses and informal channels.
364,"Over the past three years, they attended close to 60 organised industry networking sessions and learning journeys, across more than 20 sectors."
365,"Third, the curriculum."
366,We have developed a structured curriculum with defined learning outcomes.
367,"Today, in secondary schools, the ECG curriculum is about 16-20 hours."
368,"The emphasis is on career exploration, and not to make the students immediately pin-point a career to pursue."
369,"We want students to deepen their understanding of themselves through various psychological assessment tools and discussion with the Counsellors, and get a glimpse into the world of work."
370,"In polytechnics and ITE, the ECG curriculum is about 40-60 hours, where the emphasis shifts towards career planning."
371,Students develop information-gathering and decision-making skills to evaluate options and make informed career decisions.
372,Internships in their final year is an important cap stone to further clarify their interests.
373,"And before their transition to work, students are also taught good work ethics and job search skills such as resume writing and handling an employment interview."
374,"Finally, institutions are also creating more opportunities for students to be exposed to industry, meet with potential role models, and spark their passions."
375,"So there are various industry project teams, mentorship programmes, and entrepreneurship opportunities."
376,A latest initiative by the polytechnics is the Future City Programme.
377,"It brings together students from different polys and disciplines, academia, industry, and government representatives to work on various urban solutions for a city of the future."
378,"This is interesting, because it enables students to understand how different skillsets in engineering, data analytics, IT, and design can be applied in a multi-disciplinary project."
379,"It brings home the point that in ECG, we should be more focused on the purpose of our work, what we seek to achieve and the difference we want to make, as opposed to just answering the question of what I enjoy studying most."
380,You can study anything and still achieve the purpose you had set out.
381,"Let me end my speech with a story, which is a bit unconventional but interesting."
382,"This is about Mr Muhamed Faizal Bin Abdul Kadir, currently an ECG Counsellor looking after secondary schools in the West."
383,His journey of self-discovery is not short of twist and turns.
384,"He graduated with a Diploma in Business Administration, and during an internship, realised he was more interested in graphic design."
385,Sounds familiar?
386,"So after he graduated from polytechnic and enlisted into National Service, he started to learn graphic design seriously during his free time."
387,"Thereafter, he set up his own graphic design house and then became a polytechnic lecturer in digital animation."
388,"He might have taken a wrong turn when he was young, but felt that it was normal for someone's interests and aspirations to change as they grow, and whatever he has learnt is never wasted."
389,"Today, he relishes his work as an ECG Counsellor, because he can guide others who face the same situation as him."
390,Faizal also recalled a memorable case.
391,A student who was on the verge of dropping out was referred to him.
392,"She had failed her modules, repeated them and failed again."
393,"Anxious and aimless, she was unsure what her next steps were."
394,"He found out that she had previously graduated from ITE with a 4.0 GPA, but did not excel in polytechnic."
395,He made the brave but professional conclusion that the student was not ready for a polytechnic education yet.
396,"So rather than ‘scraping through poly’, which was her plan, he helped her realise the value of starting work first."
397,Faizal pointed her to a few job openings.
398,"Soon after, the student informed him that she received two job offers, including one as an administrative staff in the civil service."
399,"Now, she is happy to be working and learning new skills on the job."
400,"At some point, when she is ready and wants to complete her polytechnic education, I am sure her employer will be supportive, and the polytechnic will welcome her back."
401,"This is just one example, but I am sure we have helped hundreds like this student."
402,"This is your collective mission, to strive to find the best education and career fit for students – even if it may not seem obvious, or does not conform to conventional wisdom."
403,I wish you a fruitful symposium.
404,Thank you.
405,There's a nice quote that I came across previously: There are three apples that changed the world.
406,"The first tempted Eve, the second inspired Newton, and the third was offered to the world half-eaten by Steve Jobs."
407,"I am happy to join you today to mark the launch of the collaborations between Apple, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and three educational institutions – the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), RMIT Online, and Pathlight School."
408,"Through these collaborations, Singaporeans across all ages will be able to pick up coding skills - from introductory courses for beginners, to Professional Conversion Programmes for those who wish to enter the sector, and specialised programmes for those who are already in the sector."
409,"I want to especially thank Apple for forging these partnerships, and initiating them to create learning opportunities for our people."
410,Literacy is a basic and big part of our education system.
411,"Language literacy is critically important, and has to start from young, because it is a generative skill that makes learning everything else possible."
412,"In Singapore schools, we focus on English because of its value as a global business language; and Mother Tongue literacy because it helps the different ethnic groups in Singapore know about our own culture."
413,Digital literacy could well be considered a critical third form of literacy for the future.
414,"Not everyone needs to be an IT expert, or a professional coder."
415,"But digital technology is going to be ubiquitous, and drive almost everything we do."
416,"All of us must be able to live alongside, and make use of digital technology, much like how all of us need to know English and our Mother Tongue languages to function happily in our society."
417,"With this in mind, we need to start to demystify digital technology for the masses, and make its learning accessible to everyone."
418,We have been expanding the range of digital-oriented initiatives across our education and training landscape in Singapore.
419,"For school-going young children, we do this through the Code for Fun enrichment programme, which has been available at all our primary and secondary schools since 2017."
420,"This joint effort between MOE and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) exposes our students to coding and computational thinking, complementing what they learn in Mathematics class about logical thinking and problem solving."
421,This lays the foundation for students to pursue their interests in digital technology further through Infocomm Club Co-Curricular Activities or Applied Learning Programmes in their schools.
422,Several schools have also started creating a digital environment where students use wearable technology to make electronic payments in the school canteens and stationery shops.
423,"Through an app, their parents can keep watch over their children's spending, savings, and eating habits."
424,"Some parents protested and said they prefer cash, because children can see that they are not saving when the cash disappears."
425,But we have to get used to looking at digital numbers.
426,We are progressively rolling out the Parents Gateway mobile app to all schools.
427,"It provides a digital platform for schools to communicate with parents on school programmes and activities, and handle administrative matters more efficiently."
428,This also helps reduce administrative workload on teachers.
429,We have also leveraged technology in conducting lessons.
430,"Over the last two years, we have progressively rolled out the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)."
431,This online learning portal holds the materials for the entire curriculum of our school subjects – across all subjects and levels.
432,It provides students with resources to prepare for classes and revisit lessons.
433,"Teachers, through the SLS, can see different approaches and ideas to conduct their classes."
434,"And if they come up with a good idea, they can upload it onto the app."
435,It is a dynamic space which is still being built up.
436,"I think the growth will be exponential, and it will be strategic to education delivery in the future."
437,"We have also started to explore e-examinations, beginning with the implementation of e-oral examinations – where students talk about a video instead of a picture - across all levels for Mother Tongue Language subjects."
438,This will be extended to GCE “N” and “O” Level English in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
439,"We have also piloted computer-based writing examinations for Mother Tongue Language and Literature, and so far the feedback has been quite positive."
440,"At our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), we are ramping up our digital talent pipeline to meet the growing demand for specialists in this area."
441,"Over the last three years, the intake for Infocomm Technology courses at the National University of Singapore has more than doubled, while Nanyang Technological University’s has grown by nearly 50%."
442,SMU will be offering new computer-related courses such as the B.Sc.
443,"(Computer Science) with IT Solution Development major, for which they plan to double their initial intake over the next three years."
444,And of course SUTD has always had a strong pillar in IT.
445,"Our IHLs have also worked with various partners to roll out FinTech programmes, covering areas such as e-payment solutions, to students and teachers."
446,"Many IHLs have also created makerspaces and incubation projects, such as Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Sandbox for innovation and entrepreneurship projects, or the Singapore Institute of Technology’s SkillsCraft Community Innovation Makerspace."
447,The experience of a student in an IHL today is so different.
448,"Back in the day, we spent most of our time in libraries."
449,Today’s libraries do not even have books – everything is accessed digitally.
450,"Today, students are spending their time in makerspaces creating and tinkering with all kinds of gadgets instead."
451,"These spaces encourage our students to exercise their computational thinking skills to design, build and create things, using high-tech equipment."
452,"As for our working adults, we have a programme called SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace, a short one- or two-day workshop, which is heavily subsidised, and rolled out nationwide."
453,"It is our basic community programme to help Singaporeans equip themselves with basic digital skills, so that we can all be users of digital technology."
454,"For the more initiated, they can also take up training programmes in data analytics or cyber security, which has been made available through Government programmes such as the SkillsFuture Series and the TechSkills Accelerator."
455,All these are part of the Singapore Government’s strong digital push in our education and training ecosystem.
456,"We will continue to press on ahead with this effort, and I welcome this latest collaboration centring around Apple."
457,"Since coding is as much about the application of computer science as it is about the art of creating innovative solutions, it is quite fitting that we celebrate their launch here today in this beautiful museum."
458,"And just like the lotus flower that this building resembles, I look forward to seeing these collaborations blossom and grow."
459,"Commissioner of Prisons, Mr Desmond Chin,"
460,"NYAA Council Chairman, Mr Teo Ser Luck,"
461,"Award recipients and family members,"
462,Good morning.
463,"I am very happy and honoured to join you today, and I want to congratulate the National Youth Achievement Award or NYAA participants on completing the programme."
464,"In 2000, the NYAA programme was first introduced to youths within the Prison School."
465,The programme was subsequently extended to the youths in the Women’s Prison.
466,"The programme’s objectives remain true, even till today."
467,"It aims to encourage self-reliance, perseverance and a sense of responsibility to oneself, to society and to the nation."
468,"In 2018, I was heartened to learn that 128 of you participated in NYAA, and were involved in a range of activities that include community service with Be Kind SG and sports such as touch-rugby clinics conducted by volunteers from Born2Be."
469,"Specifically, for the community service project, the colouring sheets which you have drawn are good engagement tools for the Senior Activities Centres to meaningfully engage the elderlies in their centres."
470,"This year’s theme is “Pilot your Life, Soar to Greater Heights”."
471,"It’s a very appropriate theme, and I find it very touching."
472,"For the first time, the Singapore Prison Service also introduced the Train-the-Trainer’s model whereby the Prison Officers were trained by Singapore Adventurers’ Club to impart outdoor survival skill-sets to the NYAA participants."
473,This provided an additional opportunity for the Prison Officers to build rapport with yourselves.
474,"Indeed, the various NYAA activities have helped you to realise this year’s theme, which is “Pilot your Life, Soar to Greater Heights”."
475,"You were exposed to new experiences, whether it is participating in community service for the first time, trying a new sport, or getting involved in an outdoor activity."
476,"Through these experiences, you have become more self-aware; what you are good at, what are your shortcomings and how to improve those areas."
477,Such awareness will allow you to have better control over your life.
478,"This year, I am proud to announce that we have two NYAA gold awardees - Michael and Ahmad (not their real names)."
479,Let me share their stories about how they took charge of their lives.
480,Michael was misguided by bad company and was involved in gang activities.
481,"His family visited him regularly, prompting him to reflect on his life – what does he wish to achieve in life, what are his dreams and aspirations."
482,Michael decided to change for good so that he would not disappoint his family.
483,He renounced his ties from his gang and took up the Educational Pathway offered by the Prison School.
484,Michael started off with General Education and progressed to complete his GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Levels in the Prison School.
485,"He did well in his ‘O’ levels, scoring distinction for his Principles of Account."
486,"Currently, he is pursuing his GCE ‘A’ levels."
487,Michael is also determined to pick up new skills during his incarceration and has signed up for NYAA.
488,He will receive his Gold Award today.
489,"Next, is Ahmad."
490,"Ahmad was involved in rioting and breach of probation in 2017, which landed him in Reformative Training Centre."
491,It was only when his mother became ill and subsequently suffered a stroke that he realised the need to turn his life around for the sake of his family.
492,"Despite having a PSLE certificate, he was undeterred to pursue knowledge and upgrade himself."
493,He proceeded to further his studies with Prison School and obtained his NT certificate in 2018.
494,"Like Michael, he signed up for NYAA and will receive his Gold Award today."
495,"As part of the Gold Award requirement, both Michael and Ahmad embarked on a project to produce a foot reflexology mat that were presented to CARElderly for their residents’ use at their centre."
496,"Michael and Ahmad, I am sincerely proud of you."
497,You have shown us what it means to take charge of your own destiny and work towards realising your dreams.
498,"It takes hard work and sheer determination, and both of you have made significant progress."
499,"I hope you will continue to stay in the pilot’s seat, taking charge of your life even after the programme."
500,I want to also rally and encourage all of us here to take charge of our lives and our pilot seats.
501,This will give us a renewed view of where we are today and what is to come.
502,No one is perfect; we all have our own strengths and weaknesses.
503,"It is important for us to value our strengths, and at the same time, close the gaps in our weaknesses."
504,"For my friends here, I would like to urge you to be patient."
505,It takes time to achieve what we want.
506,We cannot expect what we want to be achieved within a short period of time.
507,"At times, when the opportunity arises, we grab it."
508,"But many times, we need to be patient."
509,We also need to stay humble in life.
510,"Life is a long journey, and you are still very young."
511,"It is important for you to have that horizon of looking far in achieving what you want, but to also remain patient and humble in doing so."
512,Now I also want to thank the family members who have stood alongside and supported the NYAA participants.
513,Your support and constant encouragement are important to their rehabilitation journey.
514,I sincerely want to thank you; I understand it is not easy for you.
515,I also want to acknowledge the contributions of our community partners.
516,"By coming on board, you have helped our NYAA participants realise their self-worth and led them to recognise that they too, can contribute back to society regardless of their past actions."
517,"I would like to give special thanks to the Singapore Adventurers’ Club, Be Kind SG, CARElderly and Born2Be for your partnership in the NYAA programme."
518,"It takes a village to raise a child, and this is the spirit we are seeing."
519,"I sincerely thank all of you, and I hope you will continue to support this very meaningful and noble effort, because every Singaporean counts."
520,I’d also like to share one more thing with the NYAA participants before I end.
521,I see your family members with us today.
522,"They never gave up on you, and they see you as their children and their family."
523,I hope that in turn you will appreciate what they are doing for you.
524,Never forget them.
525,"Wherever you are, they will always love and care for you and want to invest in you."
526,It’s only fair that you play your part.
527,I want to congratulate all of you again.
528,"I wish you all the best in your future endeavours, as you continue to pilot your life towards greater heights."
529,Thank you.
530,I am happy to join you for this year’s Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Symposium.
531,Why is ECG important?
532,"Because in life, we all need a compass which points us in the right direction that means most to us and best fulfils our aspirations and dreams."
533,"Fortunately for me, I am quite clear about my passion and career direction."
534,"Public service appeals to me most, because I want to feel that I am making a difference to many people."
535,"And while in public service, what I enjoy doing most is reforming policies and executing change management."
536,They make me want to wake up and go to work every day.
537,It gives me a kick that no other kind of assignments can.
538,"But to do change management well, I realised I need a range of skills."
539,"First of all, policy making skills – understand data, analyse trends, conclude how things need to evolve, weigh the trade-offs, and then decide on a concrete course of action."
540,It is a tough discipline that takes years to hone.
541,"But being a Minister now, I realise those are just the basics, because change management does not stop at just decision making – I need a much wider repertoire of skills."
542,"For example, I need to communicate the change clearly to the public; I need to privately persuade partners and colleagues to support the course of action; I need to further sharpen my policy analysis skills by raising my proficiency in data literacy, and using new technology to understand data; reading history helps me acquire a deeper understanding of issues and gain some wisdom; for more effective public communications it also helps greatly if I know another official language."
543,I also need to be better at campaigning during an election; I need to win in order to continue doing what I like to do.
544,"Once we know what we love to do, the career we pursue and the skills we need to acquire or deepen, naturally sort themselves out."
545,"But a fact that is perhaps surprising to many, is that I discovered my passion only in my early 40’s or late 30’s."
546,I don’t think it is late – Confucius’ prescription is that one knows your purpose in life only at 50 (“五十知天命”).
547,All those years where as a teenager I told myself I am passionate about mathematics because it was my strongest subject – that was not real passion.
548,It was what it was – my strongest academic subject.
549,"In hindsight, as a student and young working adult, I was actually quite lost."
550,"It was only when I had enough career experience, having worked in Ministries, statutory board, as a trade negotiator, as a union leader, and in the private sector, that I concluded that the kind of work that appeals to me most is what I have just described."
551,I am not alone.
552,"Most of our students, and even most of us, have not found our career compass yet, especially when the education system and modern economy present us with so many options."
553,"Students often resort to choosing courses which their friends are enrolling in, because the institutions look very cool or their parents told them to, or the entry cut-off points match their aggregate scores."
554,That is why we need ECG.
555,"It is difficult for a student to discover their passion and career purpose at a young age, but hopefully ECG can get them to start thinking about it."
556,"It is probably unrealistic to expect ECG to help every student, or even the majority of students to discover their passion during their formative education years."
557,"But it is possible to raise their level of self-awareness, help them recognise their strengths, give them some a broad idea of what kind of work brings them the most joy."
558,"Not quite a compass yet, but we would have at least magnetised the needle."
559,"For many years, straight A’s is the holy grail of many parents and students."
560,"But I think in this new era of SkillsFuture and lifelong learning, knowing one’s passion may in time be the new straight A’s, because it is our passion and inner motivations that guides us through a lifelong journey of learning, skills mastery and contributing to society."
561,"Today, we see more employers trying to suss out the inner motivations of a candidate, as opposed to just looking at their academic results."
562,"While preparing for this speech, I went back to the first speech I delivered as the Acting Minister of Higher Education and Skills."
563,"I was speaking at an OECD Conference held in Singapore, and that was when I spoke about the topic of passion and lifelong learning."
564,"I thought it may be worthwhile reiterating some of the points made then, for those beliefs continue to guide me in my work at MOE today."
565,Our education system in Singapore started off with the aim of helping our country survive and our people to earn our own living.
566,"So the system focused on imbibing common values, teaching languages, literacy and foundational skills."
567,"These national imperatives guided us in our education system, resulting in it being top-down, functional, preserving and integrating."
568,"But to a young person today, he or she may be much less attracted by the national imperatives of education."
569,"For them, education is often about choices – where and how to channel their energies and passions."
570,"They want to grow into interesting vocations and professions, where they can bring joy to people, save the environment, protect the lives of their loved ones or their fellow countrymen, cure the sick, uphold justice, or change life as we know it."
571,So we cannot just offer them career counselling and introduce to them the variety of job possibilities when what they really want to know is the meaning behind those jobs.
572,"So more and more, the objective of education is to recognise that each of us has innate talents, abilities, and interests, and our education system must help our young uncover and pursue their passions, and find out where their inner compass is pointing."
573,"Such a system is bottom-up, aspirational, changing and diversifying."
574,But it does not mean the national imperative of education has to take a back seat and give way to personal aspirations.
575,That is a false dilemma.
576,"Because now, the collective good of a competitive economy and resilient Singapore is attained only if individual Singaporeans can pursue their own talents and passions, feel that every one of us count, and our diversity of talents is complementary and nourishes our society."
577,This may put into perspective why we have the SkillsFuture movement and develop multiple pathways in the education system; why we are opening up more opportunities for lifelong learning; why we are making an effort to dial back the over-emphasis of examinations and academic grades; and phasing out the streaming system and replacing it with subject-based banding to unlock the growth mindsets of our students.
578,"While these structural changes are important, equally important are the interventions in classrooms and the lessons we are imparting to students."
579,"That is why we invested in the development of an ECG system as an integral part of our education curriculum, from secondary schools to ITE and polytechnics."
580,"Today, we have a functioning machinery that is starting to deliver results."
581,"First, in terms of physical infrastructure, we have set up dedicated ECG Centres at MOE, and at each of the polytechnics and ITE colleges."
582,"The staff of these centres organise career talks, sharing sessions and visits, and provide information resources for students and parents."
583,ECG Counsellors at the centres provide direct consultations for students.
584,"In 2018, the Counsellors saw more than 14,000 students, which is a 40% increase from 2017."
585,"Second, in terms of personnel, we have recruited about 100 ECG Counsellors."
586,We look for professionals who believe in the importance of ECG and giving guidance to our young.
587,We also ensure that ECG Counsellors come from diverse backgrounds and experiences.
588,"Today, in the polytechnics and ITE, one third of the counsellors are from the education and training profession, and two-thirds have at least five years of working experience in industries such as info-communications, banking and finance, engineering and healthcare."
589,"They are able to synthesise their experiences in the real world of work with classroom learning, and offer a healthy breadth of perspectives to enable students to make the best of their options and opportunities."
590,The ECG Counsellors are constantly developing their competencies.
591,They go through regular professional training to develop their counselling and facilitation skills.
592,They also keep their understanding of industries current through formal courses and informal channels.
593,"Over the past three years, they attended close to 60 organised industry networking sessions and learning journeys, across more than 20 sectors."
594,"Third, the curriculum."
595,We have developed a structured curriculum with defined learning outcomes.
596,"Today, in secondary schools, the ECG curriculum is about 16-20 hours."
597,"The emphasis is on career exploration, and not to make the students immediately pin-point a career to pursue."
598,"We want students to deepen their understanding of themselves through various psychological assessment tools and discussion with the Counsellors, and get a glimpse into the world of work."
599,"In polytechnics and ITE, the ECG curriculum is about 40-60 hours, where the emphasis shifts towards career planning."
600,Students develop information-gathering and decision-making skills to evaluate options and make informed career decisions.
601,Internships in their final year is an important cap stone to further clarify their interests.
602,"And before their transition to work, students are also taught good work ethics and job search skills such as resume writing and handling an employment interview."
603,"Finally, institutions are also creating more opportunities for students to be exposed to industry, meet with potential role models, and spark their passions."
604,"So there are various industry project teams, mentorship programmes, and entrepreneurship opportunities."
605,A latest initiative by the polytechnics is the Future City Programme.
606,"It brings together students from different polys and disciplines, academia, industry, and government representatives to work on various urban solutions for a city of the future."
607,"This is interesting, because it enables students to understand how different skillsets in engineering, data analytics, IT, and design can be applied in a multi-disciplinary project."
608,"It brings home the point that in ECG, we should be more focused on the purpose of our work, what we seek to achieve and the difference we want to make, as opposed to just answering the question of what I enjoy studying most."
609,You can study anything and still achieve the purpose you had set out.
610,"Let me end my speech with a story, which is a bit unconventional but interesting."
611,"This is about Mr Muhamed Faizal Bin Abdul Kadir, currently an ECG Counsellor looking after secondary schools in the West."
612,His journey of self-discovery is not short of twist and turns.
613,"He graduated with a Diploma in Business Administration, and during an internship, realised he was more interested in graphic design."
614,Sounds familiar?
615,"So after he graduated from polytechnic and enlisted into National Service, he started to learn graphic design seriously during his free time."
616,"Thereafter, he set up his own graphic design house and then became a polytechnic lecturer in digital animation."
617,"He might have taken a wrong turn when he was young, but felt that it was normal for someone's interests and aspirations to change as they grow, and whatever he has learnt is never wasted."
618,"Today, he relishes his work as an ECG Counsellor, because he can guide others who face the same situation as him."
619,Faizal also recalled a memorable case.
620,A student who was on the verge of dropping out was referred to him.
621,"She had failed her modules, repeated them and failed again."
622,"Anxious and aimless, she was unsure what her next steps were."
623,"He found out that she had previously graduated from ITE with a 4.0 GPA, but did not excel in polytechnic."
624,He made the brave but professional conclusion that the student was not ready for a polytechnic education yet.
625,"So rather than ‘scraping through poly’, which was her plan, he helped her realise the value of starting work first."
626,Faizal pointed her to a few job openings.
627,"Soon after, the student informed him that she received two job offers, including one as an administrative staff in the civil service."
628,"Now, she is happy to be working and learning new skills on the job."
629,"At some point, when she is ready and wants to complete her polytechnic education, I am sure her employer will be supportive, and the polytechnic will welcome her back."
630,"This is just one example, but I am sure we have helped hundreds like this student."
631,"This is your collective mission, to strive to find the best education and career fit for students – even if it may not seem obvious, or does not conform to conventional wisdom."
632,I wish you a fruitful symposium.
633,Thank you.
634,There's a nice quote that I came across previously: There are three apples that changed the world.
635,"The first tempted Eve, the second inspired Newton, and the third was offered to the world half-eaten by Steve Jobs."
636,"I am happy to join you today to mark the launch of the collaborations between Apple, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and three educational institutions – the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), RMIT Online, and Pathlight School."
637,"Through these collaborations, Singaporeans across all ages will be able to pick up coding skills - from introductory courses for beginners, to Professional Conversion Programmes for those who wish to enter the sector, and specialised programmes for those who are already in the sector."
638,"I want to especially thank Apple for forging these partnerships, and initiating them to create learning opportunities for our people."
639,Literacy is a basic and big part of our education system.
640,"Language literacy is critically important, and has to start from young, because it is a generative skill that makes learning everything else possible."
641,"In Singapore schools, we focus on English because of its value as a global business language; and Mother Tongue literacy because it helps the different ethnic groups in Singapore know about our own culture."
642,Digital literacy could well be considered a critical third form of literacy for the future.
643,"Not everyone needs to be an IT expert, or a professional coder."
644,"But digital technology is going to be ubiquitous, and drive almost everything we do."
645,"All of us must be able to live alongside, and make use of digital technology, much like how all of us need to know English and our Mother Tongue languages to function happily in our society."
646,"With this in mind, we need to start to demystify digital technology for the masses, and make its learning accessible to everyone."
647,We have been expanding the range of digital-oriented initiatives across our education and training landscape in Singapore.
648,"For school-going young children, we do this through the Code for Fun enrichment programme, which has been available at all our primary and secondary schools since 2017."
649,"This joint effort between MOE and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) exposes our students to coding and computational thinking, complementing what they learn in Mathematics class about logical thinking and problem solving."
650,This lays the foundation for students to pursue their interests in digital technology further through Infocomm Club Co-Curricular Activities or Applied Learning Programmes in their schools.
651,Several schools have also started creating a digital environment where students use wearable technology to make electronic payments in the school canteens and stationery shops.
652,"Through an app, their parents can keep watch over their children's spending, savings, and eating habits."
653,"Some parents protested and said they prefer cash, because children can see that they are not saving when the cash disappears."
654,But we have to get used to looking at digital numbers.
655,We are progressively rolling out the Parents Gateway mobile app to all schools.
656,"It provides a digital platform for schools to communicate with parents on school programmes and activities, and handle administrative matters more efficiently."
657,This also helps reduce administrative workload on teachers.
658,We have also leveraged technology in conducting lessons.
659,"Over the last two years, we have progressively rolled out the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)."
660,This online learning portal holds the materials for the entire curriculum of our school subjects – across all subjects and levels.
661,It provides students with resources to prepare for classes and revisit lessons.
662,"Teachers, through the SLS, can see different approaches and ideas to conduct their classes."
663,"And if they come up with a good idea, they can upload it onto the app."
664,It is a dynamic space which is still being built up.
665,"I think the growth will be exponential, and it will be strategic to education delivery in the future."
666,"We have also started to explore e-examinations, beginning with the implementation of e-oral examinations – where students talk about a video instead of a picture - across all levels for Mother Tongue Language subjects."
667,This will be extended to GCE “N” and “O” Level English in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
668,"We have also piloted computer-based writing examinations for Mother Tongue Language and Literature, and so far the feedback has been quite positive."
669,"At our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), we are ramping up our digital talent pipeline to meet the growing demand for specialists in this area."
670,"Over the last three years, the intake for Infocomm Technology courses at the National University of Singapore has more than doubled, while Nanyang Technological University’s has grown by nearly 50%."
671,SMU will be offering new computer-related courses such as the B.Sc.
672,"(Computer Science) with IT Solution Development major, for which they plan to double their initial intake over the next three years."
673,And of course SUTD has always had a strong pillar in IT.
674,"Our IHLs have also worked with various partners to roll out FinTech programmes, covering areas such as e-payment solutions, to students and teachers."
675,"Many IHLs have also created makerspaces and incubation projects, such as Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Sandbox for innovation and entrepreneurship projects, or the Singapore Institute of Technology’s SkillsCraft Community Innovation Makerspace."
676,The experience of a student in an IHL today is so different.
677,"Back in the day, we spent most of our time in libraries."
678,Today’s libraries do not even have books – everything is accessed digitally.
679,"Today, students are spending their time in makerspaces creating and tinkering with all kinds of gadgets instead."
680,"These spaces encourage our students to exercise their computational thinking skills to design, build and create things, using high-tech equipment."
681,"As for our working adults, we have a programme called SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace, a short one- or two-day workshop, which is heavily subsidised, and rolled out nationwide."
682,"It is our basic community programme to help Singaporeans equip themselves with basic digital skills, so that we can all be users of digital technology."
683,"For the more initiated, they can also take up training programmes in data analytics or cyber security, which has been made available through Government programmes such as the SkillsFuture Series and the TechSkills Accelerator."
684,All these are part of the Singapore Government’s strong digital push in our education and training ecosystem.
685,"We will continue to press on ahead with this effort, and I welcome this latest collaboration centring around Apple."
686,"Since coding is as much about the application of computer science as it is about the art of creating innovative solutions, it is quite fitting that we celebrate their launch here today in this beautiful museum."
687,"And just like the lotus flower that this building resembles, I look forward to seeing these collaborations blossom and grow."
